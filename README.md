# Apple Slicer

## What?
This script **parses App Store Connect financial reports** and **splits sales by Apple subsidiaries** which are legally accountable for them.
It may be used to help generating *Reverse Charge* invoices for accounting and in order to correctly issue *EC Sales Lists* mandatory in the EU.

## Why?

### In theory, selling apps is easy
You happily generate revenue with your apps on the App Store and Apple dutifully transfers the proceeds to you.

### In reality, though, ...
...you have to remit taxes for your App Store sales of course. For that reason, tax authorities require some sort of receipt for your income from App Store sales.
But will they accept the App Store Connect (formerly iTunes Connect) Financial Reports? Or your bank statements?

Most probably they won't. This is why you need to generate receipts by invoicing Apple using the *Reverse Charge* procedure. Well, in bureaucratic Germany, at least.

### But wait! In Europe, there is more to do
For purchases that have been made in any member state of the European Union, Apple – in the role of your sales commissionaire – is accountable for remitting associated taxes.
For that reason, your local tax authorities require you to file a periodical *EC Sales List* (also known as *ESL* or *Recapitulative Statement*) of those sales in order for them to be able to counter-check Apple's tax returns.

This is true if your business is based in the EU. In Germany, for example, the required tax document is called *Zusammenfassende Meldung*.

### Now for the problem
While due to Apple's internal cash pooling the wire transfer of your App Store proceeds is issued solely by Apple's European subsidiary in Ireland, namely Apple Distribution International<sup>*)</sup>, the amount transmitted doesn't necessarily consist of European sales only.

In fact, because Apple Distribution International also collects revenue of other countries (at the time being f. ex. also Chinese and generally "rest of world" sales), it would therefore be wrong to declare the whole sum paid by Apple Distribution International in your *ESL*.

Instead, in order to correctly declare business done between you and Apple, **the sum paid by Apple Distribution International must be split into revenue made in member states of the European Union and into revenue made in Non-EU countries**.

<sup>*)</sup> It used to be iTunes S.à.r.l. in Luxembourg until February 5th, 2017 when Apple merged it with their Irish subsidiary, Apple Distribution International.

### This is where this script comes handy
It breaks up App Store sales by country and assigns them to the specific Apple subsidiary which is legally accountable for them – for example,  *Apple Canada, Inc.* for Canadian or *iTunes K.K.* for Japanese sales.
The information which country is managed by which Apple subsidiary is taken from Schedule 2, Exhibit A of Apple's *Paid Applications* contract you signed when starting your App Store business.

You can use the output of the script to help genereating *Reverse Charge* invoices for accounting and also in order to correctly issue your *EC Sales Lists*.

## How?

In App Store Connect go to *Payments & Financial Reports* and download your financial reports (either as *Multiple Files* or *Single File*) of the desired billing month into an appropriately named directory.
For example, if you want your sales for September, 2022 to be split, download the financial reports for 2022/09 and move the resulting `*0922*.txt` into a directory named `0922`.

Additionally, in order to display revenue in your local currency, the script needs the currency exchange rates and tax withholding amounts that were applicable at the time of the payment.
They aren't included in the financial report files, but luckily App Store Connect has them available for you in an extra file which can be downloaded by clicking on the small blue icon right above the *Estimated Earnings* column. 
Place this file in the same directory as the previously downloaded reports. It should be named `financial_report.csv`.

You are now ready to execute the script with the reports directory as parameter:

```sh
./slicer.py ~/Downloads/AppStoreFinancialReports/0922
```
### Example output

The script generates tab-delimited output, more or less ready to be pasted into your favourite billing and/or tax return application.

## One more thing…

Now, how to actually report sales handled by Apple's EU subsidiary to the tax authorities? With a little help from [Steuererklärung.app](https://steuererklärung-app.de/), it's quite straightforward:
Run the script with the `-steuerapp-esl` parameter and all that's left to do is to select the current reporting period on the ESL form. Your VAT ID and address data will be remembered by the app after your first successful submission.
